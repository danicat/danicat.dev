# Editorial Guidelines

This document outlines the editorial guidelines for all articles on this technical blog. The goal is to create content that is personal, helpful, and technically accurate.

## Core Philosophy

-   **Be Helpful and Relatable:** The primary goal is to be helpful and relatable. The content should feel like a conversation with a knowledgeable peer.

## Tone of Voice

-   **Start with a Personal Connection:** The article may begin with a personal story or a relatable problem to connect with the reader.
-   **Be Honest About the Process:** Do not present a sanitized or perfect process. The article should highlight the challenges by discussing error messages, flawed initial prompts, and the process of trial-and-error. These experiences contain valuable lessons.
-   **Maintain a Professional Tone:** The tone must be that of an experienced peer sharing knowledge. Avoid overly simplistic or patronizing language.
-   **Be Grounded and Reflective:** Avoid hyperboles, overstatements, and language that sounds grandiose or overly excited. The article should feel grounded and reflective, inviting the reader to learn from the experience rather than trying to impress.
-   **Empower the Reader:** Present information objectively and avoid subjective judgments (e.g., calling a protocol "simple"). Allow the reader to form their own opinions based on the facts and the story.

## Article Structure

The goal of each article is to tell a compelling story. The structure should serve the narrative, not constrain it. To avoid a "cookie-cutter" feel and allow for serendipity, consider the following narrative models as starting points.

### Model 1: The Personal Journey (Chronological)
This is a powerful model for walking the reader through a process of discovery.
1.  **Introduction:** Introduce a problem or frustration.
2.  **Context-Setting:** Provide background information.
3.  **The Journey (Body):** Walk through the process chronologically.
4.  **Conclusion / Key Takeaways:** Summarize the lessons learned.
5.  **What's Next?:** Discuss the future of the project.
6.  **Resources and Links:** Provide a list of all URLs mentioned.

### Model 2: The Problem/Solution Deep Dive
This model is effective for complex, non-linear challenges.
-   **The Problem:** Start with a deep, thorough exploration of a specific, challenging problem. Explain its nuances and why it's difficult.
-   **The Exploration:** Detail the failed attempts, dead ends, and alternative approaches you considered. This is where the core learning happens.
-   **The Solution:** Build towards the final solution, explaining not just *what* it is, but *why* it was the most effective approach compared to the alternatives.

### Model 3: The Concept Explainer (Inverted Pyramid)
This model is ideal for introducing a new technology or concept.
-   **The Core Idea:** Begin with the main takeaway or the single most important concept. This front-loads the value for the reader.
-   **The Details:** Progressively unpack the supporting details, history, or implementation specifics in layers of increasing complexity.
-   **The Application:** Conclude with practical examples of how the concept can be applied.

## Titles and Headings

-   **Main Title:** The title should be a compelling hook. It can be a conversational question, a playful declaration, or a pop-culture reference, but it must remain professional.
-   **Headings:** Headings should be used as narrative signposts to guide the reader through the story. They should be grounded, descriptive, and professional. Clever or funny headings should be used sparingly (0-2 per article, maximum) to emphasize key moments.

## Technical Accuracy

-   **Be Precise:** All technical details, especially protocol messages and code snippets, must be accurate.
-   **Cite Your Sources:** The article must link to the official documentation, specifications, and SDKs it references.
-   **Use Real-World Examples:** Whenever possible, the article must use the actual output from tools and commands for authenticity. If a diagram is used, the source must be credited in a caption.

### Style and Word Choice to Avoid

To maintain a grounded, professional, and objective tone, avoid the following types of language:

**1. Superlatives and Absolutes:**
*   Avoid words that make absolute claims, such as "most," "best," "perfect," or "always."
*   **Examples to avoid:** "the most powerful," "the most ambitious," "the perfect solution."

**2. Overly Enthusiastic or Grandiose Language:**
*   Avoid words that sound like marketing copy or express excessive excitement. The tone should be calm and reflective, not "buzzing" with excitement.
*   **Examples to avoid:** "fundamentally changed," "shines," "buzzing," "surprisingly."

**3. Clichés and Overused Metaphors:**
*   Avoid common, often dramatic, phrases that have lost their impact through overuse.
*   **Examples to avoid:** "aha! moment," "hard-won lesson," "bogged down," "stroke of pure serendipity," "piece of the puzzle fell into place," "missing link," "side quest becomes main quest."

**4. Overly Emotional or Flowery Descriptions:**
*   Describe the thought process and strategic decisions, not emotional reactions. Keep descriptions of process concise and direct.
*   **Examples to avoid:** "startled but also amused," "a lonely struggle with a blank page," "an iterative dance of prompt and refinement."
