# Editorial Guidelines

This document outlines the editorial guidelines for all articles on this technical blog. The goal is to create content that is personal, helpful, and technically accurate.

## Core Philosophy

-   **Tell a Personal Story:** Every article should be a personal story about a technical journey. It is not just a tutorial; it's a narrative that shares the "why" and the "how," including the challenges, the discoveries, and the lessons learned.
-   **Be Helpful and Relatable:** The primary goal is to be helpful and relatable. The content should feel like a conversation with a knowledgeable peer.

## Tone of Voice

-   **Start with a Personal Connection:** The article should begin with a personal story or a relatable problem to connect with the reader.
-   **Be Honest About the Process:** Do not present a sanitized or perfect process. The article should highlight the challenges by discussing error messages, flawed initial prompts, and the process of trial-and-error. These experiences contain valuable lessons.
-   **Maintain a Professional Tone:** The tone must be that of an experienced peer sharing knowledge. Avoid overly simplistic or patronizing language.
-   **Be Grounded and Reflective:** Avoid hyperboles, overstatements, and language that sounds grandiose or overly excited. The article should feel grounded and reflective, inviting the reader to learn from the experience rather than trying to impress.
-   **Empower the Reader:** Present information objectively and avoid subjective judgments (e.g., calling a protocol "simple"). Allow the reader to form their own opinions based on the facts and the story.

## Article Structure

The article must follow this narrative flow:

1.  **Introduction:** Introduce the reader to a problem or frustration and set the stage for the journey.
2.  **Context-Setting:** If the topic is complex, provide a clear, concise explanation with analogies and links to official documentation.
3.  **The Journey (Body):** Walk through the process chronologically. Each section should represent a phase of the journey, complete with the prompts used, the results, and the lessons learned.
4.  **Conclusion / Key Takeaways:** Conclude with a summary of the most important, high-level lessons learned from the experience.
5.  **What's Next?:** Include a brief, forward-looking section that discusses the future of the project.
6.  **Resources and Links:** Provide a final, comprehensive list of all URLs mentioned in the article.

## Titles and Headings

-   **Main Title:** The title should be a compelling hook. It can be a conversational question, a playful declaration, or a pop-culture reference, but it must remain professional.
-   **Headings:** Headings should be used as narrative signposts to guide the reader through the story. They should be grounded, descriptive, and professional. Clever or funny headings should be used sparingly (1-2 per article, maximum) to emphasize key moments.

## Technical Accuracy

-   **Be Precise:** All technical details, especially protocol messages and code snippets, must be accurate.
-   **Cite Your Sources:** The article must link to the official documentation, specifications, and SDKs it references.
-   **Use Real-World Examples:** Whenever possible, the article must use the actual output from tools and commands for authenticity. If a diagram is used, the source must be credited in a caption.

### Style and Word Choice to Avoid

To maintain a grounded, professional, and objective tone, avoid the following types of language:

**1. Superlatives and Absolutes:**
*   Avoid words that make absolute claims, such as "most," "best," "perfect," or "always."
*   **Examples to avoid:** "the most powerful," "the most ambitious," "the perfect solution."

**2. Overly Enthusiastic or Grandiose Language:**
*   Avoid words that sound like marketing copy or express excessive excitement. The tone should be calm and reflective, not "buzzing" with excitement.
*   **Examples to avoid:** "fundamentally changed," "shines," "buzzing," "surprisingly."

**3. Clichés and Overused Metaphors:**
*   Avoid common, often dramatic, phrases that have lost their impact through overuse.
*   **Examples to avoid:** "aha! moment," "hard-won lesson," "bogged down," "stroke of pure serendipity," "piece of the puzzle fell into place," "missing link," "side quest becomes main quest."

**4. Overly Emotional or Flowery Descriptions:**
*   Describe the thought process and strategic decisions, not emotional reactions. Keep descriptions of process concise and direct.
*   **Examples to avoid:** "startled but also amused," "a lonely struggle with a blank page," "an iterative dance of prompt and refinement."
