I'm just coming back from the WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2025 in Berlin and I'm inspired by the many developers I've met from all over Europe and the rest of the world. Of course, the main theme this year was AI - AI is everywhere! Now we have AI in our cloud, in our computer, in our sunglasses, in our toaster, in our kitchen sink and in our toilet rolls. No one can escape from AI... not even JS frameworks can grow faster than AI! We are DOOMED!!! >.<

Or maybe not! I know that we are living some scary times. The tech industry is shifting. Companies are laying off people to the left and right using the premise that AI is making people more productive or even replacing people altogether. Whether this is the real reason for the layoffs, or AI is just an scapegoat for a hidden agenda, this is a conversation for the bar and not for this blog post, but let's just acknowledge that changes are happening.

One important life lesson that I've learned with time and experience is that you should not care about the things you cannot control. AI is inevitable, so instead of worrying about what will happen with our jobs in the future, I would like to invite you for a reflection on what AI can actually do to improve your job today.

This is the famous glass half full approach: let's transform a crisis in opportunity. So let's drop the guard for a moment and imagine what the workflow of the modern developer should look like by incorporating the "vibe" in our process.

This is actually a workflow I've been applying for the past two weeks that have been working very well, but of course, take it with a grain of salt as it is not perfect yet, but this scene is evolving every day and I believe it will only get better.

## A basic "AI-native" workflow

Let's say I need to implement a new feature for my system. The requirement for this feature could have come to me through a product owner, a product manager, an analyst or any other stakeholder. Whoever that person is, it is almost universally true that they will come will a problem or feature defined in a way that is completely impossible to implement it right away.

The number one trick in the box to take a "square" problem and make it "round" is to ask clarifying questions, so in this phase I will be bombarding the requester with questions to get a better understanding of what they are trying to achieve. This could be called the discovery phase or pre-planning.

Once I have a clearer idea of what needs to be done, it is time to narrow the scope to focus on one thing to implement first (if we are talking about an entire product, this is usually called the MVP - minimum viable product). In the traditional method, I would work together with the stakeholder to reach the agreement of what to do and in what order. This would involve one or more conversations about breaking down things and prioritisation. In Agile-land, we would call this
