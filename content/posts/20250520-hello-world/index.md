title: 'Hello World: A New Space for Technical Narratives'
summary: "An introduction to this blog's purpose: sharing technical journeys in software development, cloud computing, and AI."
---

After more than 20 years in the technology industry, I've found that the most effective way to solidify my own understanding of a topic is to share it with others. This blog, `danicat.dev`, is a dedicated space for that purpose.

My name is Daniela Petruzalek, and I'm currently a Developer Relations Engineer at Google. This blog will serve as a platform for sharing technical narratives drawn from my work in software development, cloud computing, and AI.

### Purpose and Approach

While I have shared technical content at events and on platforms like GitHub, I wanted a space to provide more detailed, story-driven articles. The goal is to move beyond simple tutorials and instead document the process of building and learning, including the challenges encountered along the way.

The site itself is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page/) theme. This choice reflects a preference for tools that are fast, simple, and customizable, which is a recurring theme in the technical decisions I often write about.

### What to Expect

The content on this blog will focus on personal technical journeys. I believe the most complex topics become clearer when presented as a narrative. You can expect articles covering:

*   **Technical Explorations:** Posts about Go, Python, Generative AI, and Data Engineering on Google Cloud.
*   **Process and Workflow:** Reflections on developer workflows, best practices, and career navigation.
*   **A Grounded Perspective:** The content will also include occasional references to my interests outside of core technology, such as cats and coffee.

This blog is an invitation to a technical conversation. I am open to collaborations and speaking engagements. If you would like to connect, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petruzalek/) or email me at [daniela@danicat.dev](mailto:daniela@danicat.dev).

Thank you for reading. I welcome your feedback and suggestions for future topics in the comments below.
