Welcome to danicat.dev! I'm Daniela Petruzalek, a software engineer with over 20 years of experience in the industry and currently working as a Developer Relations Engineer at Google. This is my new personal blog where I am going to share the latest developments in technology!

If you are already familiar with my content from my days as Google Developer Expert you might know what to expect, but if not please check out my previous content at my [public speaking](https://github.com/danicat/public-speaking) GitHub repository!

I am always open for collaborations and speaking engagements. If you want to see me at your next event, or collab with me in a video or podcast, please connect with me on LinkedIn or send me a message at [daniela@danicat.dev](mailto:daniela@danicat.dev)

That is it for now, but stay tuned for content about software engineering, Google Cloud, GenAI, data engineering and much more!

Dani =^.^=
