Hello and welcome! I'm Daniela Petruzalek.

I'm a Developer Relations Engineer at Google, where I focus on Go, Data, and the exciting world of AI Agents. This blog is my space to share what I'm learning, from best practices in backend engineering to experiments with "vibe coding."

Expect technical deep dives, career reflections, and the occasional post about cats and coffee. You can find out more about my professional background on the [About]({{< ref "about" >}}) page.
