Hello and welcome! I'm Daniela Petruzalek and this is my personal blog. I'm a technologist with experience in backend and data engineering, and I'm currently a Developer Relations Engineer at Google. In this blog I talk about technology, best practices, career and sometimes cats. You can check more about my profile in the About page.
